# Panel Output Applicaton


## Overview

 This should be a simple application to display a list of panels that have been retrieved by a API request. The panels contain a set of information which should be displayed to the user. The user should be able to select a panel for more information or to add it to their package.

## API Data Source

 The JSON file within the api/ folder should be seen as an API response and retrieved by an ajax request (fetch, axios etc.). There is no limit to how many panels could be returned.

## UI Design

 Feel free to come up with your own design, however all necessary data should be displayed preferibly in a neat easy to read format.


## Acceptance Criteria

- Display a list of panels on the page with data loaded via API request
- Panels should display all information returned from the API
- Panels should have the ability to be selected by the user (if adding to a basket)
- Panels should provide the ability to find out more information


## Deliverables
- A online Git repository or zipped Git repository with source code available, or any other deliverable you prefer.
- Instructions on how to build and run it in a web browser, preferably in the form of README.md.
